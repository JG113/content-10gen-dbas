    <h2>About this course</h2>
    <p>Learn everything you need to know to administer a MongoDB installation in production.</p>

    <p>This course begins by assuming you have no experience with MongoDB, taking you through the basics of installation. Then you will learn about JSON and Mongo's extensive query capabilities through the Mongo shell. We will cover importing, and exporting data into Mongo. After that, we cover replication and fault tolerance. Then it is on to scaling out with MongoDB, including indexing, performance tuning, monitoring, and sharding. Finally, we cover backups and recovery. No prior experience with MongoDB is assumed for this course but a knowledge of administration of other database will be helpful.</p>

          </li>
          <li>What do I need to take this class?
            <p>You will need access to a computer. A recent Windows, Mac OS or Linux based machine will work fine. </p>
          </li>
          <li>What do I receive for taking this course?
            <p>You will get a certificate of completion from 10gen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Do I need to be available during a certain hour of the day to watch the course?
          <p> The course is self-paced with weekly deadlines. The course will be broken down into short video segments with periodic assessments to check on your progress, weekly assignments and a final exam.</p></li>
          <li>How does the grading work?
          <p>You will receive your percentile rank in the course among the people who complete the course but that rank won't be on your certificate of completion. To receive a certificate of completion, you will need to achieve 65% on graded material.
          There are three different types of assessments within the course: quizzes, weekly assignments and a final exam/project. Quizzes don't count toward your grade. Quizzes are intended to help you check your own understanding. The weekly assignments will compromise one half of your grade and the final exam/project one half of your grade.
          Most assignments will be due on Mondays. Each week we will release new video lectures and a new assignments.
          We have not yet finalized a policy on late assignments.</p>
          <li> Will I be able to get help?
          <p> We will be providing online forums where students can help each other. In addition, the instructor and other 10gen employees will monitor the forums and try to help. Often the fastest answer comes from another student.  We will also be holding weekly office hours online. The technology for that is TBD.</p>
