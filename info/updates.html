  Recent Quiz/Homework Data Loss
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>We are aware of widespread reports of the site losing homework and quiz progress and have deployed a solution that will likely prevent any problems in the future.  Minor data loss may have occurred around 6PM EST during the server restart.</p>
  <p>We would like to thank the community for helping to identify these problems so that we could make corrections in the first week.</p>
